The circuit board was designed using KiCad, and manufactured with Eurocircuits. The cape was conceived as a stompbox incorporating four rotary encoders, each equipped with a switch, as well as two footswitches, all of which can be assigned based on personal preferences. The cape includes a 6.3 mm mono jack socket for audio input, two identical sockets for audio output, a 3.5 mm stereo jack socket for headphone output, and a 6.3 mm stereo jack socket for expression pedal input. In order to provide visual feedback for different modes, changes, and the status of each rotary encoder, both a bicolor LED and an OLED screen were integrated into the board. Additionally, to ensure compatibility with pedal board power supplies, a DC Barrel Jack was incorporated, enabling external power (5V/100mA) using 2.1 mm or 2.5 mm plugs with a negative polarity.
