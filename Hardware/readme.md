The circuit board was designed using KiCad, and manufactured with Eurocircuits. The cape is conceived as a stompbox incorporating four rotary encoders, each equipped with a switch, as well as two footswitches, all of which can be assigned based on personal preferences. It incorporates a 6.3 mm mono jack socket for audio input and two identical sockets for audio output, a 3.5 mm stereo jack socket for headphones output, and a 6.3 mm stereo jack socket for expression pedal input. To provide visual feedback for various modes, changes, and the status of each rotary encoder, I incorporated a bicolor LED and an OLED screen into the board. Additionally, to ensure compatibility with pedal board power supplies, I included a DC Barrel Jack that enables external power (5V/100mA) using 2.1 mm or 2.5 mm plugs with a negative polarity.
