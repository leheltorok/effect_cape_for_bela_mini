# Effect Cape for Bela Mini

A programmable open-platform effect pedal based on the Bela framework.

The objective of this project is to create a customizable guitar effects pedal using Bela's embedded computing framework. The pedal  allows guitarists to design and run their own effects on dedicated audio hardware. To achieve this, an extension cape has been developed, integrating essential components such as rotary encoders, switches, and audio inputs/outputs onto a single circuit. Additionally, a software framework has been created using Pure Data, providing all the necessary functions for utilizing the device.
