The enclosure can be crafted using any laser-cuttable material that is 3mm thick. 
I opted for a 3mm thick acrylic sheet, eliminating the need for engravings.

Additionally, to hold the case together, you will need: 

4x M2.5 5mm Female to Male Standoffs (mounted to the top of the PCB)

4x M2.5 25mm Female to Female Standoffs (mounted to the bottom of the PCB)

8x M2.5 6mm Screws (attaching both the top and bottom side of the case to the standoffs)
